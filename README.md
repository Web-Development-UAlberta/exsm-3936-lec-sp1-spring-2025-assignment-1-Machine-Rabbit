# Shallowly Simulated Car & Engine
## Contributions
Program created by Shylo Edinger, instructed by Bo Cen
## Project Features
This program demostrates Classes. It has a Car, Engine, and Transmission Classes.
The engine and transmission class is instantiated by the car class.
This program contains methods that Start the car, Stop the car, and Drive the Car.
The car after Starting, stopping and driving will then output the total distance travelled.
## Project Purpose
This program loosely simulates a car and its engine.
The car instantiates, and defaults as off. The car is turned on, and drives.
Catches for exceptions are provided, such as:
-Starting a car that is already on.
-Shutting off a car that is already off.
-Attempting to drive a car that is off.
